IDEAS: 
    
    - Have the AI (Cambria) try to contact you
        - make it childlike (who are you, will you play games with me, etc.)
    x - have MEM command make it so you see a program running like "Cambria.exe" 
        - have a way to inspect it so that cambria tries to talk to you once you've interacted with it
